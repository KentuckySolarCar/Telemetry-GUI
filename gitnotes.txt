socat can leave serial ports connected. (even after the process is killed)
When this happes, git "knows" that socat is part of an open file.
Git will then be unable to push.

lsof +D /path/  is not helpful (list open files) b/c the serial ports
are open not the socat script.

Soltion: unlink the open serial ports
       : or restart OS
